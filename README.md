# Cell Simulator Test

The project is created by `create-react-app` with some settings untouched.

## Demo

## Note
At the time it generates the next state of cells, it examines all positions of the board. Because a cell only spawns when there are neighbours, an improvement can be done by defining a boundary of existing cells.

## Install
